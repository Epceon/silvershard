        We are a small, dedicated group of two with a passion for sci-fi, action, and exploration games. Our projects are driven by feedback from our community, and we believe in continuous improvement through open testing and iteration.
      <p>
        Currently, we are working on several projects, including both PC and mobile titles. We value transparent communication and aim to keep our players updated throughout the development process.
