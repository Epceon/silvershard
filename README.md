# SilverShard Studios

This repository contains the source for the SilverShard Studios website and associated Netlify functions.

## Testing

Install dependencies and run the automated tests with:

```bash
npm install
npm test
```

These tests cover the Netlify `leaderboards` function and use Jest with the `nock` library to mock external HTTP calls.
